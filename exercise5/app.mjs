import './globalConfig.mjs';
// In the file, globalConfig, we have a function that is being executed or called on within the file. 
//When importing this file onto app.mjs, then we are also bringing in the executed function to this very 
//file. Therefore, I observe that I created a module that automatically executes code upon import.
